#  vim脚本提取文件名

## 简介

创建文件时，希望直接生成文件标题

## 快捷键

- vimrc支持函数expand，:h expand可以查看帮助
```
:echo expand('%:t')     my.txt  name of file ('tail')
:echo expand('%:p')     /abc/def/my.txt full path
:echo expand('%:p:h')   /abc/def    directory containing file ('head')
:echo expand('%:p:h:t') def First get the full path with :p (/abc/def/my.txt), then get the head of that with :h (/abc/def), then get the tail of that with :t (def)
:echo expand('%:r')     my  name of file less one extension ('root')
:echo expand('%:e')     txt name of file's extension ('extension')```
For more info run :help expand

If all that is wanted is to display the name of the current file, type Ctrl-G (or press 1 then Ctrl-G for the full path).

When using @%, the name is displayed relative to the current directory.

In insert mode, type Ctrl-R then % to insert the name of the current file.

In command mode (after typing a colon), type Ctrl-R then % to insert the name of the current file. The inserted name can then be edited to create a similar name.

In normal mode, type "%p to put the name of the current file after the cursor (or "%P to insert the name before the cursor).

The following commands insert lines consisting of the full path of the current and alternate files into the buffer:

:put =expand('%:p')
:put =expand('#:p')
```
